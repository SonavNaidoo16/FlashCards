Overview:Using Kotlin in Android Studio, create a native Android app that aids users in studying with flashcards.  
The application will ask questions, go over each flashcard in turn, and assign a score according to the user's responses.  Five questions must be asked.  Use GitHub and GitHub Actions, just like in Assignment 1.

Features:

- Five True/False flashcard questions
- Instant feedback after each answer
- Score screen with motivational feedback
- Replay quiz functionality
- Review screen with detailed explanations
